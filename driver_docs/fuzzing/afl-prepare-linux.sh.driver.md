# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to configure system settings related to core dump patterns and CPU performance. It provides narrow functionality, specifically targeting the adjustment of kernel and CPU parameters. The script sets the core dump pattern to "core" by writing to the `/proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern` file, which determines the naming convention for core dump files. Additionally, it sets the CPU frequency scaling governor to "performance" for all CPUs by writing to the `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor` path, ensuring that the CPUs operate at maximum performance. The use of `sudo` indicates that administrative privileges are required to execute these changes.
