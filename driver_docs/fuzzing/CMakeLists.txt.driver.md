# Purpose
The provided code is a CMake configuration script designed to set up a fuzz testing environment for the cJSON library using the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer. The script introduces an option `ENABLE_FUZZING` to toggle the creation of executables and targets specifically for fuzzing cJSON. If fuzzing is enabled, it checks for the presence of the `afl-fuzz` program and sets up an executable named `afl-main` linked with the cJSON library. The script also ensures that sanitizers are enabled, as they are crucial for effective fuzz testing. Additionally, it provides an option `ENABLE_FUZZING_PRINT` to decide whether to fuzz printing functions alongside the parser, and configures a custom target to execute the fuzzing process with specified input and output directories. The script also includes a conditional block to compile a separate executable for testing cJSON if `ENABLE_CJSON_TEST` is set.
