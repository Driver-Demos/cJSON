# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to automate the setup and build process for a software project with specific configurations, indicating a narrow functionality focused on preparing an environment for fuzz testing. It creates a directory named `afl-build`, navigates into it, and cleans up any existing files within it. The script then configures the build system using `cmake` with options to enable fuzzing and sanitizers, and to build static libraries, which are essential for testing and debugging purposes. Finally, it compiles the project using `make` with a target named `afl`, suggesting that the script is part of a larger project that utilizes the American Fuzzy Lop (AFL) fuzzer for security testing.
