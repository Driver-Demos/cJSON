# Purpose
The provided JSON configuration file defines the properties and behavior of a graphical widget, likely for a desktop or web application. The "widget" object contains several nested objects that specify the widget's components and their attributes. The "window" object sets the title, name, and dimensions of the main window, while the "image" object details the source, name, position, and alignment of an image within the widget. Additionally, the "text" object configures the display text, including its content, size, style, position, and alignment, and includes an event handler for mouse interactions that modifies the opacity of the image. The "debug" setting is turned on, indicating that debugging information may be displayed or logged during the widget's operation.
