# Purpose
The provided JSON configuration file defines the properties and behavior of a graphical widget, likely for a desktop or web application. The "widget" object contains several nested objects that specify the widget's components and their attributes. The "window" object sets the title, name, and dimensions of the main window, while the "image" object describes an image to be displayed, including its source file, name, position offsets, and alignment. Additionally, the "text" object configures a text element with its content, font size, style, position, and alignment, and includes an event handler for a mouse-up event that modifies the opacity of the image. This configuration allows for the customization and interactive behavior of the widget's visual elements.
