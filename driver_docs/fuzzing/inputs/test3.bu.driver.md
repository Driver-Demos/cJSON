# Purpose
The provided JSON configuration file defines the properties and behavior of a graphical widget, likely intended for use in a desktop or web application. The "widget" object contains several nested objects that specify the widget's components and their attributes. The "window" object sets the title, name, and dimensions of the main window displaying the widget. The "image" object describes an image component, including its source file, name, and positioning details. The "text" object defines a text element, detailing its content, font size, style, and position, along with an event handler for mouse interactions that modifies the opacity of the image when the text is clicked. This configuration allows for the customization and dynamic interaction of the widget's visual elements.
