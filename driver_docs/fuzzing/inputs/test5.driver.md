# Purpose
The provided content is a JSON configuration file that defines the structure and items of a menu for an SVG Viewer application. The "menu" object contains a "header" key with the value "SVG Viewer," indicating the title of the menu. The "items" array lists various menu options, each represented as an object with an "id" and, optionally, a "label" that specifies the display name of the menu item. Some entries are set to `null`, which likely serves as separators between different groups of menu items. This configuration allows the application to dynamically generate the menu interface, providing users with options such as opening files, zooming, viewing and copying SVG content, and accessing help or about information.
