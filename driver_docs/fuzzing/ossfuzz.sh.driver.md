# Purpose
This Bash script is designed to automate the build and setup process for a fuzz testing environment, specifically for the cJSON project as part of the OSS-Fuzz initiative. It provides narrow functionality, focusing on compiling the cJSON library without shared libraries and disabling tests, then building a fuzzing executable using the specified C++ compiler and flags. The script also packages input files into a seed corpus for the fuzzer and copies a dictionary file to the output directory, which aids in the fuzzing process by providing known JSON tokens. This script is intended to be executed within a Docker environment, as indicated by its reference to a Dockerfile, and is not a standalone executable or library but rather a build and setup utility.
