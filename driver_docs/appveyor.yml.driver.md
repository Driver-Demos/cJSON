# Purpose
The provided file is a configuration script for setting up a build environment using different versions of Visual Studio, specifically for a project that likely involves CMake as the build system. It defines various build options and flags, such as enabling or disabling shared libraries, cJSON utilities, and tests, across multiple Visual Studio generators and platforms (x86 and x64). The configuration includes a matrix setup to test different combinations of these options, excluding certain combinations like the x64 platform with Visual Studio 9 2008. The build script section outlines the commands to generate and build the project using CMake, with conditional logic to adjust the generator suffix based on the platform. Additionally, the script includes a failure handling mechanism to output logs if the build process encounters errors, aiding in debugging and ensuring robust build management.
