# Purpose
The provided file is a CMake configuration file, which is used to manage the build process of a software project, specifically for the cJSON library. This file provides broad functionality by defining how the cJSON library and its utilities are compiled, linked, and installed. It includes various options for enabling or disabling features such as custom compiler flags, sanitizers, symbol visibility, and shared or static library builds. The file also configures testing, localization, and export of CMake targets, ensuring that the library can be integrated into other projects. The relevance of this file to the codebase is significant, as it dictates the build environment and compilation settings, ensuring that the library is built consistently across different platforms and configurations.
# Content Summary
This CMake configuration file is designed to manage the build process for the cJSON library, a C library for parsing and generating JSON. The file specifies various build options, compiler flags, and installation instructions to ensure the library is compiled and linked correctly across different platforms and configurations.

Key technical details include:

1. **Project Setup**: The project is named `cJSON` with a version of `1.7.18`, and it requires a minimum CMake version of 3.0. The project is configured to use the C language.

2. **Compiler Flags**: Custom compiler flags are conditionally set based on the compiler being used (Clang, GNU, or MSVC). These flags enforce strict code standards and enable various warnings and protections, such as stack protection and sanitizers for address and undefined behavior.

3. **Build Options**: Several options are provided to customize the build:
   - `ENABLE_CUSTOM_COMPILER_FLAGS`: Enables custom compiler flags.
   - `ENABLE_SANITIZERS`: Enables various sanitizers for debugging.
   - `ENABLE_SAFE_STACK`: Enables SafeStack instrumentation, but cannot be used with sanitizers.
   - `ENABLE_PUBLIC_SYMBOLS` and `ENABLE_HIDDEN_SYMBOLS`: Control the visibility of library symbols.
   - `BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` and `BUILD_SHARED_AND_STATIC_LIBS`: Determine whether shared, static, or both types of libraries are built.
   - `ENABLE_CJSON_UTILS`: Enables building of the cJSON_Utils library.
   - `ENABLE_CJSON_TEST`: Enables building and running of tests.
   - `ENABLE_CJSON_UNINSTALL`: Creates an uninstall target.
   - `ENABLE_LOCALES`: Enables the use of locales.

4. **Library Configuration**: The file configures the cJSON library and optionally the cJSON_Utils library. It sets the library type (shared or static) based on the build options and links necessary dependencies. It also configures versioning for shared objects.

5. **Installation**: The configuration specifies installation paths for headers, libraries, and pkg-config files. It also supports exporting CMake targets for use in other projects.

6. **Testing and Fuzzing**: The configuration includes options to build and run tests and fuzzing targets, ensuring the library's robustness and reliability.

7. **Uninstall Target**: An uninstall target is provided to remove installed files, enhancing the manageability of the build process.

Overall, this CMake file provides a comprehensive setup for building, testing, and installing the cJSON library, with extensive customization options to suit different development environments and requirements.
