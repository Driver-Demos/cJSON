# Purpose
The provided content is a security policy document for the cjson project, outlining the procedures for handling security vulnerabilities. It emphasizes the importance of reporting any security vulnerabilities or suspected vulnerabilities privately to the cjson team to prevent potential exploitation before they are resolved. The document specifies that vulnerabilities will be addressed and patched in the next patch or minor release as quickly as possible. It provides specific contact information for reporting vulnerabilities, urging reporters to contact designated email addresses immediately rather than filing public issues on GitHub, to maintain confidentiality and protect users.
