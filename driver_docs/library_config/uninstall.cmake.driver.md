# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake script that is used to manage the removal of files listed in an installation manifest. It begins by specifying the minimum required version of CMake, which is 2.8.5, ensuring compatibility with the features used in the script. The script sets a variable `MANIFEST` to point to the `install_manifest.txt` file located in the current binary directory. It checks for the existence of this manifest file and raises a fatal error if it is not found, indicating that the installation manifest is crucial for the script's operation. The script then reads the list of files from the manifest and iterates over each file, checking if it exists or is a symbolic link. If a file exists, it attempts to remove it using the `rm` command, and if the removal fails, it raises a fatal error with the error message captured. This script is typically used in the uninstallation process to clean up files that were previously installed.
