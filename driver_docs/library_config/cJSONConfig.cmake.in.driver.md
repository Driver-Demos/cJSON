# Purpose
The provided content is a CMake configuration script used to manage the build process of the cJSON library, a popular C library for parsing JSON data. This script sets up various variables that define the build environment, such as `CJSON_INCLUDE_DIRS` and `CJSON_INCLUDE_DIR`, which specify the directories where the cJSON header files are located. It also determines whether the cJSON utilities library is built by checking the `CJSON_UTILS_FOUND` variable. Depending on the configuration options, it conditionally includes additional CMake scripts, such as `cjson.cmake` and `cjson_utils.cmake`, to handle the export of build targets. The script ensures that the appropriate libraries, `CJSON_LIBRARY` and `CJSON_UTILS_LIBRARY`, are set and included in the build process, facilitating the integration of cJSON into larger projects.
