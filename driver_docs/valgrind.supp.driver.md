# Purpose
This file is a Valgrind suppression file used to suppress specific memory check errors for ARMv7 architectures. It targets conditional memory errors (`Memcheck:Cond`) related to dynamic linker shared objects (`ld-*.so`). The suppression helps in reducing false positives during memory analysis on ARMv7 systems.
