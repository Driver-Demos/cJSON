# Purpose
The file contents specify two filenames: `.editorconfig` and `.gitignore`. This likely indicates a configuration or documentation file listing important files within a project. The `.editorconfig` file is used to maintain consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs, while the `.gitignore` file specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in a Git repository.
