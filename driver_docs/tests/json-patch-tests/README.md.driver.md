# Purpose
The document provides a comprehensive guide for creating and understanding test cases for implementations of the IETF JSON Patch standard, as defined in RFC6902. It outlines the structure of test files, which are JSON documents containing arrays of test records. Each test record includes a JSON document to test against, the patches to apply, and the expected outcome or error, with optional fields for comments and disabling tests. The document emphasizes the importance of simplicity and clarity in test cases, encouraging contributors to write descriptive comments and avoid ambiguous error tests. Additionally, it credits the initial test set to Byron Ruth's jsonpatch-js and notes contributions by Mike McCabe, while also specifying that the content is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
