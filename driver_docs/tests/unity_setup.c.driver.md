# Purpose
This code is a simple C source file that provides empty implementations for two functions, [`setUp`](#setUp) and [`tearDown`](#tearDown). These functions are typically used in unit testing frameworks to prepare and clean up the test environment before and after each test case, respectively. The comment indicates that this file addresses a compatibility issue with Microsoft's Visual Studio C compiler (MSVC), which does not support weak-linkingâ€”a feature that allows functions to be optionally overridden. By defining these functions, the code ensures that the linker has a default implementation to use, preventing linker errors when these functions are not explicitly defined elsewhere in the test suite.
# Functions

---
### setUp<!-- {{#callable:setUp}} -->
The `setUp` function is a placeholder function intended for initialization tasks before running tests, but currently does nothing.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined with no parameters and an empty body, indicating it performs no operations.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value or perform any actions.


---
### tearDown<!-- {{#callable:tearDown}} -->
The `tearDown` function is a placeholder function that is defined but does not perform any operations.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function `tearDown` is defined with a `void` return type and takes no parameters.
    - The function body is empty, indicating that it does not execute any operations or logic.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output as it is empty and has a `void` return type.
