# Purpose
The provided JSON configuration file defines the properties and behavior of a graphical widget, specifically a "Sample Konfabulator Widget." It includes settings for debugging, window dimensions, and visual elements such as an image and text. The "window" object specifies the title, name, width, and height of the widget's main window. The "image" object details the source file, name, horizontal and vertical offsets, and alignment of an image to be displayed within the widget. The "text" object configures the text to be displayed, including its content, size, style, position, and alignment, and also includes an event handler for a mouse-up event that modifies the opacity of the image, demonstrating interactive behavior.
