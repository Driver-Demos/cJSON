# Purpose
The provided JSON content defines the structure of a menu for an SVG Viewer application. It specifies a menu with a header titled "SVG Viewer" and includes a list of menu items, each represented as an object with an "id" and, optionally, a "label". The menu items include actions such as "Open", "Zoom In", "Find", and "Save As", among others, which are typical functionalities for interacting with SVG files. The presence of `null` entries indicates separators between groups of related menu items, enhancing the organization and readability of the menu. This configuration allows the application to dynamically generate its user interface menu based on the defined structure, ensuring consistency and ease of updates.
