# Purpose
The provided JSON configuration file defines the properties and behavior of a graphical widget, likely for a desktop or web application using the Konfabulator platform. The "widget" object contains several nested objects that specify the widget's settings. The "window" object sets the title, name, and dimensions of the main window, ensuring it is 500x500 pixels. The "image" object describes an image element, including its source file, name, and positioning details, with the image centered at specified offsets. The "text" object configures a text element, detailing its content, font size, style, and position, and includes an event handler for mouse interactions that modifies the opacity of the image when the text is clicked. The "debug" setting is turned on, indicating that debugging information may be displayed during the widget's execution.
