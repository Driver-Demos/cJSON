# Purpose
The provided JSON configuration file defines the structure and content of a menu for an application, specifically an SVG Viewer. The "menu" object contains a "header" titled "SVG Viewer" and an "items" array that lists various menu options, each represented by an object with an "id" and, in some cases, a "label" for display purposes. The menu items include common actions such as "Open," "Zoom In," "Find," and "Save As," among others, with some entries like "OpenNew" and "About" providing more descriptive labels. The presence of `null` entries in the array suggests separators or dividers between groups of related menu items, enhancing the menu's organization and readability. This configuration is likely used by the application to dynamically generate and display the menu interface to users.
