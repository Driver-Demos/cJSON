# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite designed to validate the functionality of JSON patch operations using the cJSON library. It leverages the Unity testing framework to execute a series of tests that apply and generate JSON patches, ensuring that the cJSON utility functions perform as expected. The file includes functions to parse test files, apply patches to JSON documents, and verify the results against expected outcomes. It also generates patches from JSON documents and checks their correctness. The tests are organized into three main functions, each targeting different sets of JSON patch test cases, which are executed in the [`main`](#main) function using Unity's test runner.

The code is structured to handle JSON data by reading test cases from files, applying patches, and comparing the results. It uses cJSON functions to manipulate JSON objects and arrays, and it checks for errors and expected results using assertions provided by the Unity framework. The file is not intended to be a standalone executable for general use but rather a specialized test suite for developers working with the cJSON library to ensure the reliability and correctness of JSON patch operations. The inclusion of headers like `unity.h` and `cJSON_Utils.h` indicates that this file is part of a larger project that uses these libraries for testing and JSON manipulation.

# Functions

---
### parse\_test\_file<!-- {{#callable:parse_test_file}} -->
The `parse_test_file` function reads a JSON file, parses its content, and returns the parsed JSON object if it is an array.
- **Inputs**:
    - `filename`: A constant character pointer representing the name of the file to be read and parsed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a character pointer `file` and a `cJSON` pointer `json` to NULL.
    - Call [`read_file`](common.h.driver.md#read_file) with `filename` to read the file content into `file`.
    - Assert that `file` is not NULL, indicating the file was read successfully.
    - Parse the JSON content of `file` using `cJSON_Parse` and store the result in `json`.
    - Assert that `json` is not NULL, indicating the JSON was parsed successfully.
    - Assert that `json` is an array using `cJSON_IsArray`.
    - Free the memory allocated for `file`.
    - Return the parsed JSON object `json`.
- **Output**: A pointer to a `cJSON` object representing the parsed JSON array from the file.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`read_file`](common.h.driver.md#read_file)


---
### test\_apply\_patch<!-- {{#callable:test_apply_patch}} -->
The `test_apply_patch` function tests the application of a JSON patch to a document and verifies the result against an expected outcome or checks for expected errors.
- **Inputs**:
    - `test`: A `cJSON` object representing a test case, which includes fields like 'doc', 'patch', 'expected', 'error', 'comment', and 'disabled'.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Retrieve the 'comment' field from the test and print it if it exists.
    - Check if the test is disabled by retrieving the 'disabled' field; if true, print 'SKIPPED' and return true.
    - Retrieve the 'doc' and 'patch' fields from the test, ensuring they are not null.
    - Create a duplicate of the 'doc' to work on, ensuring the duplication is successful.
    - Retrieve the 'expected' and 'error' fields from the test.
    - If 'error' is present, apply the patch and assert that an error occurs, setting `successful` to true.
    - If 'error' is not present, apply the patch and assert success, then compare the result with 'expected' if it exists, updating `successful` accordingly.
    - Delete the duplicated object to free memory.
    - Print 'OK' if the test was successful, otherwise print 'FAILED'.
- **Output**: Returns a `cJSON_bool` indicating whether the test was successful (true) or not (false).


---
### test\_generate\_test<!-- {{#callable:test_generate_test}} -->
The `test_generate_test` function generates and applies JSON patches to test if the transformation from a 'doc' JSON object to an 'expected' JSON object is successful.
- **Inputs**:
    - `test`: A cJSON object representing a test case, which includes 'doc', 'expected', and optionally 'disabled' fields.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Check if the test is disabled by retrieving the 'disabled' field; if true, print 'SKIPPED' and return true.
    - Retrieve the 'doc' field from the test and ensure it is not NULL.
    - Create a duplicate of the 'doc' JSON object for manipulation.
    - Retrieve the 'expected' field from the test; if it is NULL, delete the duplicate object and return true as the test is not valid without an expected result.
    - Generate a JSON patch from 'doc' to 'expected' using `cJSONUtils_GeneratePatchesCaseSensitive` and ensure it is not NULL.
    - Print the generated patch and free the memory allocated for the printed string.
    - Apply the generated patch to the duplicated 'doc' object using `cJSONUtils_ApplyPatchesCaseSensitive` and ensure it succeeds.
    - Compare the patched object with the 'expected' object to determine success.
    - Delete the patch and duplicated object to free memory.
    - Print 'generated patch: OK' if successful, otherwise print 'generated patch: FAILED'.
- **Output**: Returns a cJSON_bool indicating whether the generated patch successfully transformed the 'doc' object into the 'expected' object.

### cjson\_utils\_should\_pass\_json\_patch\_test\_tests<!-- {{#callable:cjson_utils_should_pass_json_patch_test_tests}} -->
The function `cjson_utils_should_pass_json_patch_test_tests` runs a series of JSON patch tests from a specified file and asserts that all tests pass without failure.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by parsing a JSON file named 'json-patch-tests/tests.json' into a cJSON object called `tests`.
    - It initializes a boolean variable `failed` to `false` to track if any test fails.
    - The function iterates over each test in the `tests` array using `cJSON_ArrayForEach`.
    - For each test, it calls [`test_apply_patch`](#test_apply_patch) and [`test_generate_test`](#test_generate_test), updating `failed` to `true` if either function returns `false`.
    - After iterating through all tests, it deletes the `tests` cJSON object to free memory.
    - Finally, it asserts that `failed` is `false` using `TEST_ASSERT_FALSE_MESSAGE`, indicating that all tests passed.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but asserts that all JSON patch tests pass, raising an error message if any test fails.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`parse_test_file`](#parse_test_file)
    - [`test_apply_patch`](#test_apply_patch)
    - [`test_generate_test`](#test_generate_test)

### cJSON\_ArrayForEach<!-- {{#callable:cjson_utils_should_pass_json_patch_test_cjson_utils_tests::cJSON_ArrayForEach}} -->
The `cJSON_ArrayForEach` macro iterates over each element in a cJSON array, executing a block of code for each element.
- **Inputs**:
    - `test`: A variable representing the current element in the cJSON array during iteration.
    - `tests`: A cJSON array containing elements to be iterated over.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The macro initializes the variable `test` to point to the first element of the `tests` array.
    - It enters a loop where it executes the block of code provided for each element in the array.
    - Within the loop, the [`test_apply_patch`](#test_apply_patch) function is called with the current `test` element, and its result is used to update the `failed` variable.
    - The [`test_generate_test`](#test_generate_test) function is also called with the current `test` element, and its result further updates the `failed` variable.
    - The loop continues until all elements in the `tests` array have been processed.
- **Output**: The macro itself does not produce a direct output, but it facilitates the execution of code for each element in a cJSON array, affecting variables like `failed` based on the results of the executed code.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`test_apply_patch`](#test_apply_patch)
    - [`test_generate_test`](#test_generate_test)
