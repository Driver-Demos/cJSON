# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite designed to validate the functionality of array parsing and printing in the cJSON library, a popular C library for handling JSON data. The file utilizes the Unity test framework, as indicated by the inclusion of "unity/src/unity.h", to define and run a series of unit tests. These tests focus on ensuring that JSON arrays are correctly parsed and printed in both formatted and unformatted forms. The test cases cover various scenarios, including empty arrays, arrays with a single element, and arrays with multiple elements, to ensure comprehensive coverage of potential use cases.

The core functionality is encapsulated in the [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array) function, which performs the parsing and printing operations, comparing the results against expected outputs. This function uses buffers to handle formatted and unformatted JSON strings, leveraging the cJSON library's parsing and printing capabilities. The test suite is executed through the [`main`](#CJSON_CDECLmain) function, which initializes the Unity framework, runs the defined test cases, and returns the results. This file is a critical component for maintaining the reliability and correctness of the cJSON library's array handling features, ensuring that any changes to the library do not introduce regressions in its behavior.

# Functions

### assert\_print\_array<!-- {{#callable:assert_print_array}} -->
The `assert_print_array` function verifies that a JSON array can be correctly parsed and printed in both formatted and unformatted forms, comparing the results to expected strings.
- **Inputs**:
    - `expected`: A constant character pointer representing the expected formatted JSON array string.
    - `input`: A constant character pointer representing the input JSON array string to be parsed and printed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize two buffers, `printed_unformatted` and `printed_formatted`, to store the unformatted and formatted output respectively.
    - Initialize a `cJSON` item and two `printbuffer` structures for formatted and unformatted printing.
    - Set up a `parse_buffer` with the input string and global hooks for parsing.
    - Configure the `formatted_buffer` and `unformatted_buffer` with their respective buffers, lengths, and hooks.
    - Parse the input JSON array into the `cJSON` item using `parse_array` and assert success.
    - Print the parsed array into the `unformatted_buffer` without formatting and assert the output matches the input string.
    - Print the parsed array into the `formatted_buffer` with formatting and assert the output matches the expected string.
    - Reset the `cJSON` item to clean up resources.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but uses assertions to validate the correctness of the parsing and printing operations.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`reset`](common.h.driver.md#reset)


---
### print\_array\_should\_print\_empty\_arrays<!-- {{#callable:print_array_should_print_empty_arrays}} -->
The function `print_array_should_print_empty_arrays` tests if the [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array) function correctly handles and prints empty JSON arrays.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array) with two identical string arguments representing an empty JSON array: "[]".
    - The [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array) function is expected to parse the input string as a JSON array and then print it in both formatted and unformatted forms.
    - The function checks if the printed output matches the expected output, which is also an empty JSON array.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value; it is used for testing purposes and relies on assertions to validate behavior.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array)


---
### print\_array\_should\_print\_arrays\_with\_one\_element<!-- {{#callable:print_array_should_print_arrays_with_one_element}} -->
The function `print_array_should_print_arrays_with_one_element` tests the [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array) function to ensure it correctly handles arrays with a single element.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array) four times with different single-element arrays as both the expected and input arguments.
    - Each call to [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array) checks if the input array is correctly parsed and printed in both formatted and unformatted forms.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it is used for testing purposes to validate array printing functionality.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array)


---
### print\_array\_should\_print\_arrays\_with\_multiple\_elements<!-- {{#callable:print_array_should_print_arrays_with_multiple_elements}} -->
The function `print_array_should_print_arrays_with_multiple_elements` tests the ability of the [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array) function to correctly format and print arrays with multiple elements.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array) twice with different sets of expected and input strings representing arrays.
    - The first call checks if the array '[1, 2, 3]' is correctly formatted and printed from the input '[1,2,3]'.
    - The second call checks if the array '[1, null, true, false, [], "hello", {\n\t}]' is correctly formatted and printed from the input '[1,null,true,false,[],"hello",{}]'.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it uses assertions to validate the correctness of array formatting and printing.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`assert_print_array`](#assert_print_array)


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:CJSON_CDECL::main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and runs a series of unit tests for verifying the correct printing of JSON arrays using the Unity test framework.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `UNITY_BEGIN()` to initialize the Unity test framework.
    - It then runs three test functions using `RUN_TEST()`: `print_array_should_print_empty_arrays`, `print_array_should_print_arrays_with_one_element`, and `print_array_should_print_arrays_with_multiple_elements`.
    - Finally, it calls `UNITY_END()` to conclude the test run and returns the result of the test execution.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code from `UNITY_END()`, indicating the result of the test execution.
