# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite designed to validate the functionality of JSON object parsing and printing using the cJSON library. It leverages the Unity test framework to define and execute a series of unit tests that ensure JSON objects are correctly parsed and printed in both formatted and unformatted styles. The file includes several static functions, each responsible for testing specific scenarios, such as printing empty JSON objects, objects with a single element, and objects with multiple elements. These tests use the [`assert_print_object`](#assert_print_object) function to compare the expected output with the actual output generated by the cJSON library functions, ensuring that the library behaves as expected.

The code is structured to be executed as a standalone program, with a [`main`](#CJSON_CDECLmain) function that initializes the Unity test framework, runs the defined tests, and returns the results. The inclusion of headers like "unity.h" and "common.h" suggests that this file is part of a larger test suite or project that uses Unity for testing and possibly shares common utilities or configurations. The file does not define public APIs or external interfaces; instead, it focuses on internal validation of the cJSON library's capabilities, making it a crucial component for maintaining the reliability and correctness of JSON handling within applications that utilize this library.

# Functions

### assert\_print\_object<!-- {{#callable:assert_print_object}} -->
The `assert_print_object` function verifies that a JSON object can be correctly parsed and printed in both formatted and unformatted forms, comparing the results to expected strings.
- **Inputs**:
    - `expected`: A constant character pointer to the expected formatted JSON string.
    - `input`: A constant character pointer to the input JSON string to be parsed and printed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize buffers for formatted and unformatted printing, and a buffer for parsing the input JSON string.
    - Set up the parse buffer with the input string and its length, and assign global hooks.
    - Set up the formatted and unformatted print buffers with their respective buffers, lengths, offsets, and hooks.
    - Clear the cJSON item structure to prepare it for parsing.
    - Parse the input JSON string into the cJSON item structure, asserting success.
    - Print the parsed JSON object into the unformatted buffer, asserting success, and compare it to the input string, asserting equality.
    - Print the parsed JSON object into the formatted buffer, asserting success, and compare it to the expected string, asserting equality.
    - Reset the cJSON item structure after the test.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it uses assertions to validate the parsing and printing operations.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`reset`](common.h.driver.md#reset)


---
### print\_object\_should\_print\_empty\_objects<!-- {{#callable:print_object_should_print_empty_objects}} -->
The function `print_object_should_print_empty_objects` tests if an empty JSON object is correctly printed in both formatted and unformatted styles.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`assert_print_object`](#assert_print_object) with two arguments: a formatted empty JSON object string "{\n}" and an unformatted empty JSON object string "{}".
    - The [`assert_print_object`](#assert_print_object) function is responsible for parsing the input JSON string, printing it in both formatted and unformatted styles, and asserting that the printed results match the expected strings.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value; it performs assertions to validate the behavior of JSON object printing.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`assert_print_object`](#assert_print_object)


---
### print\_object\_should\_print\_objects\_with\_one\_element<!-- {{#callable:print_object_should_print_objects_with_one_element}} -->
The function `print_object_should_print_objects_with_one_element` tests the [`assert_print_object`](#assert_print_object) function to ensure it correctly formats JSON objects with a single element.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`assert_print_object`](#assert_print_object) four times with different JSON objects, each containing a single element.
    - Each call to [`assert_print_object`](#assert_print_object) checks if the input JSON string is correctly parsed and printed in both formatted and unformatted forms.
    - The function does not have any conditional logic or loops; it simply executes a series of assertions.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it is used for testing purposes and relies on assertions to validate behavior.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`assert_print_object`](#assert_print_object)


---
### print\_object\_should\_print\_objects\_with\_multiple\_elements<!-- {{#callable:print_object_should_print_objects_with_multiple_elements}} -->
The function `print_object_should_print_objects_with_multiple_elements` tests the ability of the [`assert_print_object`](#assert_print_object) function to correctly format and print JSON objects with multiple elements.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`assert_print_object`](#assert_print_object) twice with different sets of JSON objects as input and expected formatted output.
    - The first call checks if a JSON object with three integer elements is correctly formatted and printed.
    - The second call checks if a JSON object with various data types (integer, null, boolean, array, string, and empty object) is correctly formatted and printed.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it uses assertions to validate the correctness of JSON object formatting and printing.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`assert_print_object`](#assert_print_object)


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:CJSON_CDECL::main}} -->
The `main` function initializes the Unity test framework and runs a series of tests to verify the correct printing of JSON objects.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `UNITY_BEGIN()` to initialize the Unity test framework.
    - It then calls `RUN_TEST` for each of the test functions: `print_object_should_print_empty_objects`, `print_object_should_print_objects_with_one_element`, and `print_object_should_print_objects_with_multiple_elements`.
    - Each `RUN_TEST` call executes the corresponding test function to verify JSON object printing functionality.
    - Finally, the function calls `UNITY_END()` to conclude the test run and returns its result.
- **Output**: The function returns the result of `UNITY_END()`, which indicates the success or failure of the test suite.
