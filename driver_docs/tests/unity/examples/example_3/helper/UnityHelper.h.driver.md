# Purpose
This code is a C header file designed to facilitate unit testing by providing macros and a function prototype for asserting the equality of two `EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T` structures. It includes a function declaration [`AssertEqualExampleStruct`](#AssertEqualExampleStruct) that compares two instances of `EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T` and takes an additional parameter for the line number, which is useful for debugging. The file defines two macros: `UNITY_TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T` and `TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T`, which simplify the process of writing test assertions by automatically passing the current line number and a null message to the assertion function. This header is likely part of a larger testing framework, helping developers ensure that their data structures behave as expected during unit tests.

### AssertEqualExampleStruct<!-- {{#callable_declaration:AssertEqualExampleStruct}} -->
Compares two EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T instances for equality in a test.
- **Description**: Use this function to assert that two instances of EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T are equal during unit testing. It compares the 'x' and 'y' fields of the structures and reports a test failure if they differ. This function is typically used within a test framework to validate that the actual output of a function matches the expected result. The 'line' parameter is used to indicate the line number in the test file where the assertion is made, aiding in debugging.
- **Inputs**:
    - `expected`: An instance of EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T representing the expected values. The caller retains ownership.
    - `actual`: An instance of EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T representing the actual values to compare against the expected. The caller retains ownership.
    - `line`: An unsigned short indicating the line number in the test file where this assertion is called. It is used for reporting purposes.
- **Output**: None
