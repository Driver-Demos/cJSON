# Purpose
This code is a C function implementation intended for use with the Unity Test Framework, which is a unit testing framework for C. The function [`AssertEqualExampleStruct`](#AssertEqualExampleStruct) is designed to compare two instances of a structure, `EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T`, by checking if their integer fields `x` and `y` are equal. If the fields do not match, the function uses Unity's assertion macros to report a failure, specifying the line number and a custom error message indicating which field failed the comparison. This function is useful for validating that two structures are identical in unit tests, ensuring that the logic manipulating these structures behaves as expected.

### AssertEqualExampleStruct<!-- {{#callable:AssertEqualExampleStruct}} -->
The function `AssertEqualExampleStruct` asserts that two `EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T` structures are equal by comparing their `x` and `y` fields.
- **Inputs**:
    - `expected`: An `EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T` structure representing the expected values for comparison.
    - `actual`: An `EXAMPLE_STRUCT_T` structure representing the actual values to be compared against the expected values.
    - `line`: An unsigned short integer indicating the line number in the test file where the assertion is being made.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls `UNITY_TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_INT` to compare the `x` field of the `expected` and `actual` structures, using the provided `line` number for error reporting.
    - If the `x` fields are not equal, an assertion failure message 'Example Struct Failed For Field x' is generated.
    - The function then calls `UNITY_TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_INT` to compare the `y` field of the `expected` and `actual` structures, again using the `line` number for error reporting.
    - If the `y` fields are not equal, an assertion failure message 'Example Struct Failed For Field y' is generated.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs assertions and may cause the test to fail if the fields of the structures do not match.
