# Purpose
This Ruby code is a Rakefile, which is a build automation tool used to define tasks and dependencies for a project, specifically for managing the build and test process of a software project. The code provides narrow functionality tailored to setting up, building, and testing a project, likely related to the Unity testing framework, as indicated by the task names and directory structure. It defines several tasks, such as `prepare_for_tests`, `unit`, `summary`, and `all`, which automate the creation of necessary directories, running unit tests, generating test summaries, and cleaning up temporary files. The code also includes a mechanism to load a default configuration file and allows for custom configurations through the `:config` task. Overall, this Rakefile is designed to streamline the development workflow by automating repetitive tasks associated with building and testing the project.
