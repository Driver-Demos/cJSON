# Purpose
This code is a simple C function prototype declaration. It defines a function named [`ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested`](#ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested) that takes two parameters: an integer `Poor` and a pointer to a character `LittleFunction`, and returns a pointer to a character. The function name humorously suggests that it has not been tested, indicating that it might be a placeholder or a work-in-progress. This prototype is likely part of a larger C program, serving as a forward declaration to inform the compiler about the function's existence and its signature before its actual implementation is provided elsewhere in the codebase.
