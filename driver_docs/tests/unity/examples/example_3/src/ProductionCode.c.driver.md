# Purpose
This C source code file contains a small collection of global variables and functions, primarily focused on searching an array and returning specific values. The file includes an integer array `NumbersToFind` initialized with nine elements, which is intended to be searched using the function [`FindFunction_WhichIsBroken`](#FindFunction_WhichIsBroken). This function is designed to return the index of a specified number within the array, but it contains a logical error due to improper loop and conditional statement placement, causing it to always return 0. Additionally, the file defines a global integer `Counter` and a function [`FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable`](#FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable), which simply returns the value of `Counter`. The code appears to be part of a larger project, likely intended for testing purposes, as indicated by the comments highlighting the intentional flaw in the search function.

# Global Variables

---
### Counter
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `Counter` variable is a global integer initialized to 0. It is accessible throughout the file and can be used by any function within the file.
- **Use**: `Counter` is used to store a count or tally that can be accessed and modified by multiple functions within the file.


---
### NumbersToFind
- **Type**: `int[]`
- **Description**: `NumbersToFind` is a global integer array containing 9 elements, initialized with specific values. The array is intended to be used with 1-based indexing, which is unconventional in C where arrays are typically 0-based.
- **Use**: This array is used in the `FindFunction_WhichIsBroken` function to search for a specific number and return its index if found.


# Functions

---
### FindFunction\_WhichIsBroken<!-- {{#callable:FindFunction_WhichIsBroken}} -->
The function `FindFunction_WhichIsBroken` attempts to find a specified number in a predefined array and return its index, but due to a logic error, it does not function correctly.
- **Inputs**:
    - `NumberToFind`: The integer value that the function attempts to locate within the `NumbersToFind` array.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize integer `i` to 0.
    - Enter a `while` loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 8.
    - Increment `i` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
    - After the loop, check if `NumbersToFind[i]` equals `NumberToFind`.
    - If the condition is true, return the current value of `i`.
    - If the loop completes without finding the number, return 0.
- **Output**: The function returns the index of `NumberToFind` in the `NumbersToFind` array if found; otherwise, it returns 0.


---
### FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable<!-- {{#callable:FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable}} -->
The function `FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable` returns the value of a global variable `Counter`.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function accesses the global variable `Counter`.
    - The function returns the current value of `Counter`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, which is the current value of the global variable `Counter`.
