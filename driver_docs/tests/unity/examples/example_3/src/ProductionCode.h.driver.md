# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that declares two function prototypes. The first function, [`FindFunction_WhichIsBroken`](#FindFunction_WhichIsBroken), takes an integer parameter `NumberToFind` and is presumably intended to search for or process this number, though its name suggests it may not be functioning correctly. The second function, [`FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable`](#FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable), does not take any parameters and is expected to return a local variable, though the specifics of its operation are not detailed here. This header file likely serves as an interface for a corresponding C source file where these functions are implemented.
