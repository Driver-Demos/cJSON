# Purpose
This C source code file contains a single function definition, [`ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested`](#ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested), which is part of a larger codebase, as indicated by the inclusion of the header file "ProductionCode2.h". The function takes two parameters, an integer `Poor` and a string `LittleFunction`, but does not utilize them, as evidenced by the casting to void. The function currently returns a null pointer, suggesting it is a placeholder or a stub meant for future development. The comments within the function indicate that it lacks associated tests, and the use of `TEST_IGNORE` suggests that it is part of a test-driven development process where the function is acknowledged but not yet implemented or tested.
