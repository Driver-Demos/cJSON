# Purpose
This file is a Makefile used in a C project that utilizes the Unity Test Framework, which is a unit testing framework for C. The Makefile is designed to automate the build and test process by defining a set of rules and variables that dictate how the software should be compiled and executed. It begins by detecting the operating system to adjust commands accordingly, such as setting the appropriate cleanup and directory creation commands, and determining the target file extension. The file specifies the C compiler to use, defaulting to `gcc` but switching to `clang` on macOS. It also defines compiler flags to enforce coding standards and warnings, and lists the source files and include directories necessary for building the test executable. The `all` target cleans previous builds and compiles the project, while the `default` target compiles and runs the tests. The `ci` target adds an additional compiler flag to treat warnings as errors, ensuring stricter code quality during continuous integration.
