# Purpose
This code is a function prototype in C, which serves as a declaration for a function named [`ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested`](#ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested). The function takes two parameters: an integer `Poor` and a pointer to a character `LittleFunction`, and it returns a pointer to a character. The name of the function suggests that it might be experimental or not yet verified for correctness, indicating that it could be part of a larger codebase under development or testing. This prototype would typically be found in a header file, allowing other source files to call the function once it is defined elsewhere.
