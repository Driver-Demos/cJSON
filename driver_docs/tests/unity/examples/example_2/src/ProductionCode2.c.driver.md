# Purpose
This code is a simple C function definition within a source file, likely intended for testing or development purposes. The function [`ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested`](#ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested) takes an integer and a character pointer as parameters but does not utilize them, as indicated by the casting to void, which is a common practice to suppress unused variable warnings. The function currently returns a null pointer, suggesting it is a placeholder or a stub for future implementation. The comments within the function indicate that it is not yet tested and hint at the use of a testing framework, possibly with a `TEST_IGNORE` directive, to ensure it is not overlooked in future test development.

### ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested<!-- {{#callable:ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested}} -->
ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested is a placeholder function that currently does nothing and returns a null pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `Poor`: An integer input that is currently unused in the function.
    - `LittleFunction`: A character pointer input that is currently unused in the function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes two parameters, an integer and a character pointer, but does not use them.
    - Both parameters are explicitly cast to void to indicate they are intentionally unused.
    - The function returns a null pointer, indicating no meaningful operation is performed.
- **Output**: The function returns a null pointer (char*), indicating no valid string or data is returned.
