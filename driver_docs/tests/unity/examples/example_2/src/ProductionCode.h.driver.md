# Purpose
This code is a simple C header file that declares two function prototypes. The first function, [`FindFunction_WhichIsBroken`](#FindFunction_WhichIsBroken), takes an integer parameter `NumberToFind` and is presumably intended to search for or process this number, although its name suggests it may not function correctly. The second function, [`FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable`](#FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable), does not take any parameters and is expected to return a local variable, though the specifics of its implementation are not provided here. This header file likely serves as an interface for other C source files to include and use these functions, indicating that the actual logic and functionality are defined elsewhere.
