# Purpose
This code is a function prototype declaration in C, indicating that it is likely part of a header file or a section of a C source file where functions are declared before their implementation. The function, named [`ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested`](#ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested), takes two parameters: an integer `Poor` and a pointer to a character `LittleFunction`, and it returns a pointer to a character. The naming of the function suggests it may be experimental or not yet verified for correctness, which is a useful note for developers who might use or modify this function. The purpose of this declaration is to inform the compiler about the function's signature, allowing it to be called elsewhere in the code before its actual definition is encountered.
