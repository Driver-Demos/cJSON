# Purpose
This C source code file defines a single function, [`ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested`](#ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested), which appears to be a placeholder or a stub for future development. The function takes two parameters, an integer `Poor` and a string `LittleFunction`, but does not utilize them in any meaningful computation, as indicated by the casting of these parameters to void to suppress unused variable warnings. The function currently returns a null pointer, suggesting that its implementation is incomplete. The accompanying comment indicates that the function lacks tests and includes a reminder to use `TEST_IGNORE` in a testing framework, highlighting the intention to revisit and properly implement and test this function in the future.

### ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested<!-- {{#callable:ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested}} -->
ThisFunctionHasNotBeenTested is a placeholder function that currently does nothing and returns a null pointer.
- **Inputs**:
    - `Poor`: An integer input that is currently unused in the function.
    - `LittleFunction`: A character pointer input that is currently unused in the function.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes two parameters, an integer and a character pointer, but does not use them.
    - Both parameters are explicitly cast to void to suppress unused variable warnings.
    - The function returns a null pointer, indicating no meaningful operation is performed.
- **Output**: The function returns a null pointer (char*), indicating no valid string or data is returned.
