# Purpose
This C source code file provides a narrow functionality focused on searching for a number within a predefined array and returning its index. The file includes a header file, "ProductionCode.h," suggesting that it is part of a larger codebase, possibly for testing or demonstration purposes. The primary function, [`FindFunction_WhichIsBroken`](#FindFunction_WhichIsBroken), is intended to search through the `NumbersToFind` array and return the index of a specified number. However, the function contains logical errors, such as incorrect loop control and misplaced conditional checks, which prevent it from functioning as intended. These errors are likely intentional to serve as a test case for debugging or educational purposes, as indicated by the comments within the code.

Additionally, the file defines a global variable `Counter` and a simple function [`FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable`](#FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable), which returns the value of `Counter`. This function does not perform any complex operations and serves as a straightforward example of returning a global variable's value. The code does not define any public APIs or external interfaces, and its primary purpose seems to be to illustrate common programming errors and the importance of testing and debugging in software development.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `ProductionCode.h`


# Global Variables

---
### Counter
- **Type**: `int`
- **Description**: The `Counter` variable is a global integer initialized to zero. It is accessible throughout the file and can be used by any function within the file.
- **Use**: `Counter` is used to store a count or tally that can be accessed and modified by multiple functions, as seen in `FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable`.


---
### NumbersToFind
- **Type**: `int[9]`
- **Description**: The `NumbersToFind` variable is a global integer array consisting of 9 elements. It is initialized with specific integer values, where the first element is 0, and the subsequent elements are 34, 55, 66, 32, 11, 1, 77, and 888. The array is intended to be used with 1-based indexing, which is unconventional in C.
- **Use**: This array is used in the `FindFunction_WhichIsBroken` function to search for a specific number and return its index if found.


# Functions

---
### FindFunction\_WhichIsBroken<!-- {{#callable:FindFunction_WhichIsBroken}} -->
The function `FindFunction_WhichIsBroken` attempts to find a specified number in a predefined array and return its index, but due to a logic error, it always returns 0.
- **Inputs**:
    - `NumberToFind`: The integer value that the function attempts to locate within the NumbersToFind array.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize integer variable `i` to 0.
    - Enter a while loop that continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to 8.
    - Increment `i` by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
    - After the loop, check if the current element in `NumbersToFind` at index `i` equals `NumberToFind`.
    - If a match is found, return the index `i`.
    - If no match is found after the loop, return 0.
- **Output**: The function returns the index of the found number in the array if it matches `NumberToFind`, otherwise it returns 0.


---
### FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable<!-- {{#callable:FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable}} -->
The function `FunctionWhichReturnsLocalVariable` returns the value of a global variable `Counter`.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function accesses the global variable `Counter`.
    - It returns the current value of `Counter`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, which is the current value of the global variable `Counter`.
