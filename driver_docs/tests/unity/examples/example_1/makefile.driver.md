# Purpose
This file is a Makefile used in a C project that employs the Unity Test Framework, which is a unit testing framework for C. The Makefile is designed to automate the build and test process across different operating systems by detecting the OS and adjusting commands accordingly. It defines variables for the C compiler, compiler flags, source files, and target executables, ensuring that the correct tools and options are used for compilation. The file includes rules for building the project, running tests, and cleaning up generated files, with specific commands for creating directories and removing files based on the operating system. Additionally, it includes a rule for generating test runner files using a Ruby script, which is part of the Unity framework's automation tools.
