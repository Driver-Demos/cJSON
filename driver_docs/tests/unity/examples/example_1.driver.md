## Folders
- **[src](example_1/src.driver.md)**: The `src` folder in the `cJSON` codebase contains C source and header files that define and declare functions for searching arrays and handling local variables, as well as a placeholder function for future testing.
- **[test](example_1/test.driver.md)**: The `test` folder in the `cJSON` codebase contains unit tests and autogenerated test runners for the `ProductionCode` and `ProductionCode2` modules, utilizing the Unity testing framework to verify functionality and demonstrate test scenarios.

## Files
- **[makefile](example_1/makefile.driver.md)**: The `makefile` in the `cJSON` codebase at `example_1/makefile.driver.md` is used to compile and run C test programs using the Unity test framework, with support for different operating systems and compilers.
- **[readme.txt](example_1/readme.txt.driver.md)**: The `readme.txt` file provides instructions for building and running a basic example of Unity tests using the `make` command.
