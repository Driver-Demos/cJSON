## Folders
- **[src](example_2/src.driver.md)**: The `src` folder in the `cJSON` codebase contains source and header files for production code, including functions for searching arrays and handling local variables, as well as a placeholder function for future testing.
- **[test](example_2/test.driver.md)**: The `test` folder in the `cJSON` codebase contains unit tests and test runners for the `ProductionCode` and `ProductionCode2` modules, utilizing the Unity test framework.

## Files
- **[makefile](example_2/makefile.driver.md)**: The `makefile` in the `cJSON` codebase at `example_2/makefile.driver.md` is used to compile and run C tests using the Unity test framework, with configurations for different operating systems and compilers.
- **[readme.txt](example_2/readme.txt.driver.md)**: The `readme.txt` file explains that Example 2 demonstrates using Unity's test fixture to group tests and simplify writing test runners.
