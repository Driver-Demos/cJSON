# Purpose
This Ruby script is a module generator for the Unity Test Framework, which is used for testing C code. The script automates the creation of necessary files for a new module, including source files, header files, and test files. It supports different design patterns such as model-conductor-hardware (MCH), driver-interrupt-hardware (DIH), and model-view-presenter (MVP), among others. The script allows for customization of file paths, naming conventions, and includes options for updating version control systems like Subversion. It provides both generation and destruction functionalities, enabling users to create or remove module files as needed.

The script defines a class `UnityModuleGenerator` that encapsulates the logic for generating and destroying module files. It uses templates for source, header, and test files, which are populated with module-specific information. The script can be executed from the command line, where it parses various options to customize the module generation process. These options include specifying paths for source, include, and test files, choosing a design pattern, and setting naming conventions. The script also supports reading configuration from a YAML file, allowing for further customization. Overall, this script provides a streamlined way to manage module files in a Unity Test Framework project, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort.

# Classes

### UnityModuleGenerator
- **Description**: The `UnityModuleGenerator` class is designed to automate the creation and management of module files for the Unity Test Framework, which is used for testing C code. It provides functionality to generate source, header, and test files based on specified patterns and configurations. The class supports different design patterns such as 'src', 'test', 'dh', 'dih', 'mch', and 'mvp', each defining a specific structure of files and their interdependencies. It allows customization through options that can be passed as a hash or loaded from a YAML configuration file. The class also includes methods to create, destroy, and manage these files, with optional integration with version control systems like Subversion.

**Class Methods**

---
#### UnityModuleGenerator\.default\_options
The `default_options` method returns a hash containing default configuration options for the UnityModuleGenerator class.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The method is defined as a class method using `self.default_options`.
    - It returns a hash with predefined key-value pairs representing default settings.
- **Output**: A hash with default configuration options, including keys like `pattern`, `includes`, `update_svn`, `boilerplates`, `test_prefix`, and `mock_prefix`.


---
#### UnityModuleGenerator\.grab\_config
The `grab_config` method loads configuration options from a YAML file and merges them with default options.
- **Inputs**:
    - `config_file`: A string representing the path to a YAML configuration file, which may contain configuration options under the keys :unity or :cmock.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize `options` with default options by calling `default_options`.
    - Check if `config_file` is not nil or empty.
    - If `config_file` is valid, require the 'yaml' library and load the YAML file contents into `yaml_guts`.
    - Merge the contents of `yaml_guts[:unity]` or `yaml_guts[:cmock]` into `options`.
    - Raise an error if neither :unity nor :cmock sections are found in the YAML file.
    - Return the `options` hash.
- **Output**: A hash containing configuration options, either default or merged with those from the YAML file.


**Instance Methods**

---
#### UnityModuleGenerator\.files\_to\_operate\_on
The `files_to_operate_on` method generates a list of file specifications for a given module name and pattern, determining the necessary source, header, and test files to be created or operated on.
- **Inputs**:
    - `module_name`: The name of the module for which files are to be generated, potentially including path information.
    - `pattern`: An optional string specifying the design pattern to use for file generation, defaulting to the pattern specified in the options or 'src' if not provided.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Extracts the directory and base name from the provided module name.
    - Defines a triad of file configurations for source, header, and test files, using options for paths, templates, and boilerplates.
    - Determines the pattern to use, defaulting to the provided pattern or the one in options, and retrieves the corresponding pattern configuration.
    - Raises an error if the specified pattern is not recognized.
    - Filters the triad to only include test files if the pattern is 'test'.
    - Iterates over each configuration in the triad and each file pattern, creating a list of file specifications with paths, names, templates, boilerplates, and includes.
- **Output**: Returns an array of hashes, each representing a file specification with details such as path, name, template, boilerplate, and includes.


---
#### UnityModuleGenerator\.initialize
The `initialize` method sets up default options and file paths for a Unity module generator, based on provided options or configuration files.
- **Inputs**:
    - `options`: An optional argument that can be a String representing a configuration file path, a Hash of options, or nil for default options.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Determine the current directory path and store it in the variable `here`.
    - Initialize `@options` with default options from `UnityModuleGenerator.default_options`.
    - Check the type of `options` argument: if nil, use default options; if a String, merge options from a configuration file; if a Hash, merge directly; otherwise, raise an error.
    - Set default file paths for source, include, and test directories if they are not provided in `@options`.
    - Ensure that the paths for source, include, and test directories end with a '/'.
    - Initialize `@patterns` with predefined patterns for different module types.
- **Output**: The method does not return a value; it initializes instance variables `@options` and `@patterns` for use in the Unity module generator.
