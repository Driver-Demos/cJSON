# Purpose
The provided YAML configuration file is designed for use with a tool called `generate_module`, which is likely a script or program used to automate the generation of code modules. This file allows users to customize the behavior of `generate_module` by specifying default paths for source, include, and test directories, as well as whether to update a Subversion (SVN) repository. It also allows users to define additional files to include in each category (source, include, test) and to specify boilerplate comments that should be inserted at the top of generated files, with placeholders for file names. This configuration file enhances flexibility and adaptability, enabling users to tailor the module generation process to fit their specific project structure and requirements.
