# Purpose
This C header file is part of the Unity Test Framework, a unit testing framework designed for C programming. The file defines a comprehensive set of macros and functions that facilitate the creation and execution of unit tests. It provides a broad range of functionality, including setup and teardown functions for individual tests and entire test suites, as well as a wide array of assertion macros for validating test conditions. These assertions cover various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, pointers, strings, and arrays, and they support both simple and complex comparisons, such as equality, inequality, and range checks. The file also includes configuration options that allow users to customize the framework's behavior, such as output settings and data type specifications.

The file serves as a public API for the Unity Test Framework, offering external interfaces that can be used by developers to integrate unit testing into their C projects. It is intended to be included in other C source files, providing the necessary tools to define and execute tests. The header file also supports conditional compilation, allowing users to enable or disable specific features based on their needs. This flexibility makes the Unity Test Framework a versatile tool for ensuring code quality and reliability in C applications.
# Imports and Dependencies

---
- `unity_internals.h`


# Functions

---
### setUp<!-- {{#callable:setUp}} -->
The `setUp` function is a placeholder function intended to be called before each test in the Unity test framework.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as an empty function, meaning it contains no operations or logic.
    - It is intended to be overridden by the user to include any setup operations needed before each test case.
    - The function is declared as a weak symbol, allowing it to be optionally overridden in other translation units.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value or output.


---
### tearDown<!-- {{#callable:tearDown}} -->
The `tearDown` function is a placeholder function intended to be called after each test in a test suite, but it currently does nothing.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as `void tearDown(void)` indicating it takes no parameters and returns no value.
    - The function body is empty, meaning it performs no operations when called.
    - The function is marked with `#pragma weak tearDown`, suggesting it can be overridden by a user-defined version if needed.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output or perform any operations.


---
### suiteSetUp<!-- {{#callable:suiteSetUp}} -->
The `suiteSetUp` function is a placeholder function intended to be called at the beginning of a test suite, but it currently has no implementation.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function is defined as a void function, meaning it does not return any value.
    - The function body is empty, indicating no operations are performed when it is called.
    - The function is marked with `#pragma weak suiteSetUp`, suggesting it can be overridden by a user-defined implementation if needed.
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output.


---
### suiteTearDown<!-- {{#callable:suiteTearDown}} -->
The `suiteTearDown` function returns the number of test failures passed to it, which can be used as the exit code of the main function.
- **Inputs**:
    - `num_failures`: An integer representing the number of test failures in the test suite.
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function takes an integer input `num_failures`.
    - It directly returns the value of `num_failures`.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer, which is the same as the input `num_failures`, representing the number of test failures.
