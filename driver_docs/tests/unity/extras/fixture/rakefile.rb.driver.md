# Purpose
This Ruby code is a Rake-based build script for managing and automating tasks related to the Unity Test Framework, which is a test framework for C. The script provides narrow functionality focused on setting up, building, and testing the Unity Framework. It defines several tasks using Rake, such as preparing directories for tests, running unit tests, and cleaning up build artifacts. The script also includes a mechanism to load a default configuration file for the toolchain and allows for custom configurations through a task. Additionally, it supports continuous integration tasks and can disable colored output for test results. Overall, the code is designed to streamline the development and testing process for projects using the Unity Test Framework.
