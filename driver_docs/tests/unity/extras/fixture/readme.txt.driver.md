# Purpose
The provided text is a copyright and licensing notice for a software component related to the Unity Project, which is a test framework for the C programming language. It acknowledges the contributions of James Grenning and others to the Unity Project and specifies that the framework is released under the MIT License, directing users to refer to a separate license.txt file for detailed licensing terms. Additionally, the text describes an optional add-on to the Unity framework, which allows users to include `unity_framework.h` instead of `unity.h` to utilize features similar to those in CppUTest. This add-on introduces the concept of test groups and provides enhanced control over test execution via the command line, thereby extending the functionality of the Unity test framework.
