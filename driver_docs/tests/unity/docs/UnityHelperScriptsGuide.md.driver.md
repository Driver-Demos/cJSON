# Purpose
The provided content is a documentation excerpt for Ruby scripts used in conjunction with the Unity testing framework, which is designed to facilitate unit testing in C projects. The document describes two main scripts: `generate_test_runner.rb` and `unity_test_summary.rb`. The `generate_test_runner.rb` script automates the creation of test runner files by scanning C test files for functions that represent test cases, thus simplifying the process of managing and executing tests. It supports configuration through YAML files or Ruby hashes, allowing users to specify options such as included headers, setup and teardown routines, and plugins. The `unity_test_summary.rb` script aggregates test results from multiple test files, providing a comprehensive summary of test outcomes, including passed, failed, and ignored tests. This documentation is crucial for developers using Unity and CMock, as it streamlines the testing process and enhances the efficiency of test management within a C codebase.
# Content Summary
The provided document is a detailed guide on two Ruby scripts included in the Unity project, designed to assist developers in managing and executing C test cases more efficiently. These scripts are optional tools that require Ruby to be installed on the developer's system.

### `generate_test_runner.rb`

This script automates the creation of test runner files for C test cases. It scans a given test file for functions prefixed with "test" or "spec" and generates a corresponding runner file that includes a `main` function to execute these test cases. The script can be executed from the command line, and it supports additional configuration through a YAML file or directly via Ruby code. Key options include:

- **`:includes`**: Specifies header files to be included in the runner file.
- **`:suite_setup` and `:suite_teardown`**: Define C code to be executed before and after all test cases, respectively.
- **`:enforce_strict_ordering`**: Ensures compatibility with CMock's strict order feature.
- **`:plugins`**: Allows the inclusion of plugins like CException for enhanced test case handling.

The script can be integrated into build systems using Ruby, such as Rake, allowing for flexible and automated test runner generation.

### `unity_test_summary.rb`

This script aggregates and summarizes the results of test cases executed across multiple test files. It processes files with `.testpass` and `.testfail` extensions to compile a comprehensive report of test outcomes, including the number of tests run, ignored, and failed. The summary also lists specific tests that were ignored or failed, providing a clear overview of the test suite's status. The script can be run from the command line, with options to specify paths for locating test result files, making it adaptable for integration into various development environments, including IDEs like Eclipse.

Overall, these scripts enhance the Unity testing framework by automating test runner creation and providing detailed test summaries, thereby streamlining the testing process for C developers.
