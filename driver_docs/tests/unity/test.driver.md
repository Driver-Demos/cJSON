## Folders
- **[expectdata](test/expectdata.driver.md)**: The `expectdata` folder in the `cJSON` codebase contains a collection of autogenerated test runner and header files designed to execute and manage unit tests using the Unity framework, with some files also incorporating mock management through CMock and Mockstanky.
- **[spec](test/spec.driver.md)**: The `spec` folder in the `cJSON` codebase contains RSpec tests for the `UnityModuleGenerator` class, specifically focusing on scenarios where module files already exist.
- **[targets](test/targets.driver.md)**: The `targets` folder in the `cJSON` codebase contains various YAML configuration files for setting up different compiler environments and architectures, including Clang, GCC, Hi-Tech PICC18, and IAR Embedded Workbench, to build and test the cJSON project across multiple platforms and settings.
- **[testdata](test/testdata.driver.md)**: The `testdata` folder in the `cJSON` codebase contains header and source files that define macros, functions, and test scripts for exception handling, mock object management, and test runner generation in a C testing environment.
- **[tests](test/tests.driver.md)**: The `tests` folder in the `cJSON` codebase contains files dedicated to testing the functionality of the Unity Test Framework and the `generate_test_runner.rb` script, including parameterized tests and comprehensive unit tests for various data types and scenarios.

## Files
- **[.rubocop.yml](test/.rubocop.yml.driver.md)**: The `.rubocop.yml` file in the `cJSON` codebase configures RuboCop to use a specific Ruby version and customizes various style and security checks, including disabling certain metrics and documentation requirements.
- **[Makefile](test/Makefile.driver.md)**: The `Makefile` in the `cJSON/tests/unity/test` directory is used to compile and run unit tests with coverage analysis for the cJSON project, utilizing GCC or Clang depending on the system, and includes various compiler flags and definitions for the Unity test framework.
- **[rakefile](test/rakefile.driver.md)**: The `rakefile` in the `cJSON` codebase sets up tasks for building, testing, and checking the style of the Unity test framework for C, utilizing Rake and RSpec.
- **[rakefile_helper.rb](test/rakefile.driver.md_helper.rb)**: The `rakefile_helper.rb` file in the `cJSON` codebase provides a set of helper methods for configuring, compiling, linking, and running unit tests using the Unity test framework for C projects.
