# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite for the cJSON library, specifically focusing on testing the utility functions provided by the cJSON_Utils module. The file includes a series of test cases that validate the functionality of JSON operations such as JSON Pointer retrieval, JSON object sorting, and JSON Merge Patch operations. The tests are implemented using the Unity test framework, which is a popular unit testing framework for C. The file includes several static functions, each dedicated to testing a specific aspect of the cJSON utilities, such as [`json_pointer_tests`](#json_pointer_tests), [`misc_tests`](#misc_tests), [`sort_tests`](#sort_tests), [`merge_tests`](#merge_tests), and [`generate_merge_tests`](#generate_merge_tests). These functions create JSON objects, perform operations using cJSON utility functions, and assert the expected outcomes using Unity's assertion macros.

The main function orchestrates the execution of these test cases by calling `UNITY_BEGIN()` to initialize the test framework, running each test function with `RUN_TEST()`, and concluding with `UNITY_END()` to summarize the test results. The file is structured to ensure comprehensive coverage of the cJSON utility functions, verifying their correctness and robustness. This test suite is crucial for developers who rely on the cJSON library for JSON manipulation, as it helps ensure that the library's utility functions behave as expected across various scenarios. The inclusion of the Unity framework and the structured approach to testing make this file an integral part of maintaining the reliability and stability of the cJSON library.

# Global Variables

---
### merges
- **Type**: ``static const char *[15][3]``
- **Description**: The `merges` variable is a static constant two-dimensional array of strings, with dimensions 15x3. Each element in the array represents a JSON merge test case, consisting of three JSON strings: the original JSON object, the patch to be applied, and the expected result after the patch is applied.
- **Use**: This variable is used in the `merge_tests` and `generate_merge_tests` functions to validate JSON merge operations by comparing the actual merge results with the expected outcomes.


# Functions

---
### json\_pointer\_tests<!-- {{#callable:json_pointer_tests}} -->
The `json_pointer_tests` function tests the functionality of JSON Pointers by verifying that specific JSON paths correctly retrieve the expected elements from a JSON object.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a `cJSON` object `root` to `NULL` and define a JSON string `json` with various key-value pairs, including special characters.
    - Parse the JSON string into a `cJSON` object using `cJSON_Parse` and assign it to `root`.
    - Use `TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_PTR` to verify that `cJSONUtils_GetPointer` retrieves the correct `cJSON` object for various JSON Pointer paths, comparing them to the expected objects obtained via `cJSON_GetObjectItem`.
    - Test JSON Pointer paths include root, array elements, and keys with special characters such as '/', '%', '^', '|', '\', '"', ' ', and '~'.
    - After all assertions, delete the `cJSON` object `root` to free memory.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs assertions to validate JSON Pointer functionality.


---
### misc\_tests<!-- {{#callable:misc_tests}} -->
The `misc_tests` function performs various tests on JSON pointer construction and validation using the cJSON library.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize an array of integers and several cJSON pointers to NULL.
    - Create a JSON object and an integer array JSON object from the numbers array.
    - Retrieve the 6th element from the integer array JSON object.
    - Add the integer array JSON object to the main JSON object under the key 'numbers'.
    - Find and validate JSON pointers from the main object to specific elements and objects, checking the correctness of the pointer strings.
    - Create additional JSON objects with special characters in keys, find pointers to these objects, and validate the pointer strings.
    - Free allocated memory for pointers and delete created JSON objects to prevent memory leaks.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs assertions to validate JSON pointer functionality.


---
### sort\_tests<!-- {{#callable:sort_tests}} -->
The `sort_tests` function creates a JSON object with unsorted keys, sorts it, and verifies the sorting order.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a string `random` containing the alphabet in a random order and a buffer `buf` for single characters.
    - Create a JSON object `sortme` using `cJSON_CreateObject()`.
    - Iterate over the `random` string, adding each character as a key to the `sortme` object with a value of 1 using `cJSON_AddItemToObject()`.
    - Sort the `sortme` object using `cJSONUtils_SortObject()`.
    - Verify the sorting by iterating through the sorted JSON object's children and asserting that each key is greater than or equal to the previous key using `TEST_ASSERT_TRUE()`.
    - Delete the `sortme` object using `cJSON_Delete()` to free memory.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs assertions to verify the sorting of JSON object keys.


---
### merge\_tests<!-- {{#callable:merge_tests}} -->
The `merge_tests` function performs a series of JSON Merge Patch tests by applying patches to JSON objects and verifying the results against expected outcomes.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize variables `i`, `patchtext`, and `after` to zero and NULL respectively.
    - Print a message indicating the start of JSON Merge Patch tests.
    - Iterate over a predefined set of 15 test cases using a for loop.
    - For each test case, parse the JSON strings from the `merges` array to create `cJSON` objects for the object to be merged and the patch.
    - Print the unformatted patch JSON to `patchtext`.
    - Apply the patch to the object using `cJSONUtils_MergePatch`.
    - Print the unformatted result of the merged object to `after`.
    - Assert that the result matches the expected JSON string from the `merges` array using `TEST_ASSERT_EQUAL_STRING`.
    - Free the memory allocated for `patchtext` and `after`.
    - Delete the `cJSON` objects for the merged object and the patch to free memory.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs assertions to validate JSON merge operations.


---
### generate\_merge\_tests<!-- {{#callable:generate_merge_tests}} -->
The `generate_merge_tests` function generates and verifies JSON merge patches for a set of predefined test cases.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize a loop counter `i` to 0 and a pointer `patchedtext` to NULL.
    - Iterate over 15 predefined test cases stored in the `merges` array.
    - For each test case, parse the initial JSON string (`merges[i][0]`) into a cJSON object `from`.
    - Parse the expected result JSON string (`merges[i][2]`) into a cJSON object `to`.
    - Generate a merge patch from `from` to `to` using `cJSONUtils_GenerateMergePatch`.
    - Apply the generated patch to `from` using `cJSONUtils_MergePatch`.
    - Convert the patched `from` object to an unformatted JSON string `patchedtext`.
    - Assert that `patchedtext` matches the expected result JSON string (`merges[i][2]`).
    - Clean up by deleting the cJSON objects `from`, `to`, and `patch`, and freeing the `patchedtext` string.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value; it performs assertions to verify the correctness of JSON merge patches.
