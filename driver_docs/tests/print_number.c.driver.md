# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite designed to validate the functionality of the `print_number` function, which is part of the cJSON library. The file utilizes the Unity test framework to define and execute a series of test cases that ensure the correct conversion of various numeric values into their string representations. The tests cover a range of scenarios, including zero, positive and negative integers, positive and negative real numbers, and edge cases involving scientific notation. The code also includes a placeholder for testing non-numeric values, although this is currently marked to be ignored due to limitations in C89.

The file is structured to include necessary headers for the Unity framework and cJSON library, and it defines several static functions, each corresponding to a specific test case. The [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) function is a helper function that performs the actual validation by comparing the expected string output with the result produced by `print_number`. The [`main`](#CJSON_CDECLmain) function orchestrates the execution of all test cases using Unity's `RUN_TEST` macro, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the `print_number` function's behavior. This test suite is crucial for maintaining the reliability and correctness of the cJSON library's number printing capabilities.

# Functions

---
### assert\_print\_number<!-- {{#callable:assert_print_number}} -->
The `assert_print_number` function verifies that a given double value is correctly converted to a string representation and matches an expected string, adjusting for certain formatting differences in exponent notation.
- **Inputs**:
    - `expected`: A constant character pointer representing the expected string output of the number conversion.
    - `input`: A double representing the number to be converted and printed.
- **Control Flow**:
    - Initialize buffers and a cJSON item to store the number representation.
    - Set the number value in the cJSON item using the input double.
    - Attempt to print the number into the buffer and assert success with a message if it fails.
    - Iterate over the new_buffer to adjust the exponent notation by removing unnecessary zeros in certain conditions.
    - Assert that the printed buffer matches the expected string, with a message if it does not.
- **Output**: The function does not return a value but asserts that the printed number matches the expected string, potentially causing a test failure if the assertion fails.

### print\_number\_should\_print\_zero<!-- {{#callable:print_number_should_print_zero}} -->
The function `print_number_should_print_zero` tests if the [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) function correctly prints the number zero as a string "0".
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) with the expected string "0" and the number 0 as arguments.
    - The [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) function is responsible for verifying that the number 0 is correctly converted to the string "0" and printed as such.
- **Output**: This function does not return any value; it is used for testing purposes to ensure correct functionality of number printing.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number)


---
### print\_number\_should\_print\_negative\_integers<!-- {{#callable:print_number_should_print_negative_integers}} -->
The function `print_number_should_print_negative_integers` tests the [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) function to ensure it correctly prints negative integer values as strings.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) three times with different negative integer values and their expected string representations.
    - Each call to [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) checks if the negative integer is correctly converted to its string representation and asserts the result.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs assertions to validate the behavior of [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number).
- **Functions called**:
    - [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number)


---
### print\_number\_should\_print\_positive\_integers<!-- {{#callable:print_number_should_print_positive_integers}} -->
The function `print_number_should_print_positive_integers` tests the [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) function to ensure it correctly prints positive integer values as strings.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) three times with different positive integer values: 1.0, 32767.0, and 2147483647.0.
    - Each call to [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) checks if the number is correctly converted to its string representation and matches the expected output.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it is used for testing purposes to validate the correct behavior of number printing.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number)


---
### print\_number\_should\_print\_positive\_reals<!-- {{#callable:print_number_should_print_positive_reals}} -->
The function `print_number_should_print_positive_reals` tests the [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) function to ensure it correctly prints various positive real numbers, including those in scientific notation.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) multiple times with different pairs of expected string representations and corresponding double values.
    - Each call to [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) checks if the double value is correctly converted to its string representation and matches the expected string.
    - The function does not return any value and relies on assertions to validate the correctness of the number printing.
- **Output**: The function does not produce a direct output but uses assertions to verify that positive real numbers are printed correctly.
- **Functions called**:
    - [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number)

### print\_number\_should\_print\_negative\_reals<!-- {{#callable:print_number_should_print_negative_reals}} -->
The function `print_number_should_print_negative_reals` tests the [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) function to ensure it correctly prints negative real numbers in string format.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function calls [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) multiple times with different pairs of string representations and negative real numbers.
    - Each call to [`assert_print_number`](#assert_print_number) checks if the negative real number is correctly converted to its string representation.

### print\_number\_should\_print\_non\_number<!-- {{#callable:print_number_should_print_non_number}} -->
The function `print_number_should_print_non_number` is a placeholder for a test that is currently ignored and intended to verify the printing of non-numeric values like NaN and infinity.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `TEST_IGNORE()` to mark the test as ignored.
    - Comments indicate that the test is not easily implementable in C89, suggesting a limitation in the language standard for handling non-numeric values.
    - The commented-out code suggests intended assertions to check if non-numeric values (NaN, INFTY, -INFTY) are printed as "null".
- **Output**: The function does not produce any output as it is currently ignored and contains no executable code.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:CJSON_CDECL::main}} -->

- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Call `UNITY_BEGIN()` to initialize the Unity test framework.
    - Execute `RUN_TEST` for each test case function: `print_number_should_print_zero`, `print_number_should_print_negative_integers`, `print_number_should_print_positive_integers`, `print_number_should_print_positive_reals`, `print_number_should_print_negative_reals`, and `print_number_should_print_non_number`.
