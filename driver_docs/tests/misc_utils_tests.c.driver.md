# Purpose
This C source code file is a test suite designed to validate the robustness of the cJSON utility functions, particularly ensuring that they handle null pointers gracefully without crashing. The file utilizes the Unity Test Framework, as indicated by the inclusion of "unity/src/unity.h" and the use of macros such as `TEST_ASSERT_NOT_NULL` and `TEST_ASSERT_NULL`. The primary focus of the test function [`cjson_utils_functions_shouldnt_crash_with_null_pointers`](#cjson_utils_functions_shouldnt_crash_with_null_pointers) is to call various cJSON utility functions with null arguments and verify that they return null or handle the input without causing a crash. This is crucial for ensuring the stability and reliability of the cJSON library when dealing with potentially invalid or unexpected input.

The file is structured as an executable test program, with a [`main`](#main) function that initializes the Unity test framework and runs the defined test case. The test case covers a range of cJSON utility functions, such as `cJSONUtils_GetPointer`, `cJSONUtils_GeneratePatches`, and `cJSONUtils_ApplyPatches`, among others. By systematically testing these functions with null inputs, the code ensures that the cJSON library is robust against null pointer dereferences, which are common sources of runtime errors in C programs. This test suite is an essential component of the software development process, providing a safeguard against regressions and ensuring that the library maintains its integrity across updates and modifications.

# Functions

---
### cjson\_utils\_functions\_shouldnt\_crash\_with\_null\_pointers<!-- {{#callable:cjson_utils_functions_shouldnt_crash_with_null_pointers}} -->
The function `cjson_utils_functions_shouldnt_crash_with_null_pointers` tests various cJSON utility functions to ensure they handle null pointers gracefully without crashing.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - Create a cJSON string object named `item` and assert it is not null.
    - Test `cJSONUtils_GetPointer` with null arguments and assert the result is null.
    - Test `cJSONUtils_GetPointerCaseSensitive` with null arguments and assert the result is null.
    - Test `cJSONUtils_GeneratePatches` with null arguments and assert the result is null.
    - Test `cJSONUtils_GeneratePatchesCaseSensitive` with null arguments and assert the result is null.
    - Call `cJSONUtils_AddPatchToArray` with various null arguments to ensure no crash occurs.
    - Test `cJSONUtils_ApplyPatches` with null arguments to ensure no crash occurs.
    - Test `cJSONUtils_ApplyPatchesCaseSensitive` with null arguments to ensure no crash occurs.
    - Test `cJSONUtils_MergePatch` with null arguments and assert the result is null.
    - Recreate the `item` object and test `cJSONUtils_MergePatchCaseSensitive` with null arguments, asserting the result is null.
    - Test `cJSONUtils_FindPointerFromObjectTo` with null arguments and assert the result is null.
    - Call `cJSONUtils_SortObject` and `cJSONUtils_SortObjectCaseSensitive` with null arguments to ensure no crash occurs.
    - Delete the `item` object to free memory.
- **Output**: The function does not return any value; it performs assertions to verify that the cJSON utility functions handle null pointers without crashing.


---
### main<!-- {{#callable:main}} -->
The `main` function initializes and runs a unit test using the Unity test framework to ensure that cJSON utility functions handle null pointers without crashing.
- **Inputs**: None
- **Control Flow**:
    - The function begins by calling `UNITY_BEGIN()` to initialize the Unity test framework.
    - It then calls `RUN_TEST()` with the test function `cjson_utils_functions_shouldnt_crash_with_null_pointers` as an argument to execute the test.
    - Finally, it calls `UNITY_END()` to finalize the test run and return the result.
- **Output**: The function returns an integer status code from `UNITY_END()`, which indicates the result of the test execution.
